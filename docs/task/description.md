The website pages

● ‘Students’ - the list of students (firstname, last name, username, password, email)

● A page for creating/editing a new student profile

● The list of workshops (name, description)

● In the ‘Students’ page there should be an opportunity to subscribe students to a
workshop. There should be a dropdown list which contains the names of workshops.
First you should select a workshop from the dropdown list, then select students from the
student list and press the ‘subscribe’ button.

● A separate script which sends emails to the students who have been subscribed to
workshops.

● A ‘workshop view’ page which displays the list of students who have subscribed to the
workshop and the status of email (was email sent or not).
